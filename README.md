## Setup

This project runs on [CKAN](http://github.com/ckan/ckan). This repo is
self-contained, all the source code you need to run the project is within the
repo. CKAN and re-usable extensions are included as submodules. To check them
out, run:

```git submodule update```

If you are used to setting up CKAN development environments, you can follow
your usual workflow.

Alternatively, you can also initialize this repo as a
[datacats](http://github.com/boxkite/datacats) environment:

```
pip install datacats
cd communitydata.io/
datacats init
```
